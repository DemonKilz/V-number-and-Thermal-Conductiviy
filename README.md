V-Number
A normalized frequency parameter, which determines the number of modes of a step-index optical fiber.
Symbol : V 
Units: (dimensionless number)")

For V values below ≈ 2.405, a fiber supports only one mode per polarization direction (→ single-mode fibers)
The V number determines the fraction of the optical power in a certain mode which is confined to the fiber core.
For single-mode fibers, that fraction is low for low V values (e.g. below 1), and reaches ≈ 90% near the single-mode cut-off at V ≈ 2.405
Multimode fibers can have much higher V numbers.
For large values, the number of supported modes of a step-index fiber can be calculated as M ≈ V**2/2  (**=square)


Thermal-Conductiviy
Definition: The rate at which heat passes through a specified material, expressed as the amount of heat that flows per unit time through a unit area with a temperature gradient of one degree per unit distance is known as thermal conductivity.
It's unit is kg/m/K.

Uses:
Materials of high thermal conductivity are widely used in heat sink applications and materials of low thermal conductivity are used as thermal insulation.
Metals with high thermal conductivity, e.g. copper, exhibit high electrical conductivity.
